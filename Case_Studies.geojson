Following an extensive design competition led by CPDA, ultimately OLIN+Studios Architecture was chosen as the lead designer. The proposal was a 3-block linear rain garden, with other filtration strategies. WC Smith was interested in re-generating this site due to its proximity to adjacent, partially-owned multifamily housing.", "Stakeholders": "WC Smith (developer), Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (gov. corp.), OLIN and Studios Architecture (designer), Vika Capitol\nNitsch Engineering, ", "Links": "a" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -77.0, 38.88 ] } }
